Nerdz — A Focus-First Study Platform Built by Students

Nerdz is a distraction-free study platform designed to help students learn effectively in one focused environment. It brings together essential study tools—notes, structured study sessions, progress tracking, and role-based access—without the chaos of tab switching and unnecessary noise found in most online study setups.

Built with a Go backend, MySQL 8.0, and a clean frontend, Nerdz is engineered as a real production system, not a demo project. The platform emphasizes performance, security, and scalability while staying simple and student-centric.

🚀 Key Features

Secure Authentication & Roles
Role-based access for students and teachers with hashed passwords and JWT authentication.

Distraction-Free Study Environment
Centralized place for notes, study sessions, and learning workflows.

Backend-Driven Architecture
Go (Golang) backend with strict API validation and MySQL as the single source of truth.

Production-Ready Infrastructure
Dockerized services, Cloudflare Tunnel for secure exposure, and Caddy as a reverse proxy.

Optimized for Low-Resource Systems
Tuned to run efficiently even on Raspberry Pi (ARM64), proving real-world deployment capability.

🛠 Tech Stack

Backend: Go (net/http)

Database: Oracle MySQL 8.0 (Dockerized)

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Infrastructure: Docker, Docker Compose, systemd

Security: JWT, bcrypt, strict SQL modes

🎯 Project Philosophy

Nerdz is built with a simple idea:

If studying online feels chaotic, the system is broken.

This project focuses on clarity, correctness, and control—from database design to deployment—making it a strong example of real backend engineering and production thinking by students.
