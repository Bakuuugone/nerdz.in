Nerdz is a distraction-free study platform built to help students learn in one focused environment. It combines secure authentication, role-based access, and structured study tools with a Go backend and MySQL 8.0. Deployed using Docker and Cloudflare Tunnel, Nerdz is designed as a real production system, not a demo.
